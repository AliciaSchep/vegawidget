    desc: >
      The central *object* of this package is a `vegaspec`, which is also
      a `list`. Use these functions to coerce to a `vegaspec`,
      format as JSON, or otherwise operate on a `vegaspec`. If you have
      [**nodejs**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed,
      you can compile a Vega-Lite specification to a Vega specification.

  - title: "Rendering: vegawidget"
    desc: >
      The central *side-effect* of this package is to render a `vegawidget`,
      which is also an `htmlwidget`. A `vegawidget` is
      built using a `vegaspec`. A helper function is provided for
      [vega-embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) options. These options
      can be specified as an argument to the `vegawidget` function,
      or as an R option, `vega.embed`, which would picked up by the
      `knit_print` method.
      If the [**webshot**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=webshot)
      package and PhantomJS are installed, knitting to a non-html format should
      "just work".

  - title: Shiny
    desc: >
      Render vegawidgets in Shiny; also, access Vega datasets, signals,
      and events from Shiny. The function `vw_shiny_demo()` lets you
      run any of this package's demo apps; call it without arguments
      to see the list of available apps. There is also an
      [article](../articles/shiny.html) that goes into some detail.

  - title: JavaScript
    desc: >
      Adding JavaScript listners and composing JavaScript handlers.
      These provide you the same capability to access Vega charts
      as with Shiny, but *you* are responsible for providing all the
      HTML and JS code to make it work. To see some examples, please
      see this [article](../articles/javascript.html).

      If you have [**nodejs**](https://nodejs.org/en/)
      installed, you can convert and write a `vegaspec` or a
      `vegawidget` to SVG. To convert to a bitmap, or to write
      to a PNG file, you will need the
      [**rsvg**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsvg) package.

      You can use `use_vegawidget()` to bring this package's functionality to
      yours. Much like `usethis::use_pipe()` allows you to re-export the pipe
      in your package's namespace, `use_vegawidget()` does this for many of
      these functions, as detailed in this [article](../articles/import.html).
      The other functions deal with serializing date-times,
      and versions of Vega's JavaScript libraries.

    - vw_serialize_data
    - vega_version
