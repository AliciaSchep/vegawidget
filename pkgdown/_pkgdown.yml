      The central *object* of this package is `vegaspec`, which is also
      a `list`. Use these functions to coerce to a `vegaspec`,
      format as JSON, or otherwise operate on a `vegaspec`. If the
      [**V8**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=V8) package is installed,
      you can translate a Vega-Lite specification to a Vega specification.

  - title: Rendering a vegaspec
    desc: >
      The central *side-effect* of this package is to render a `vegawidget`,
      which is also an `htmlwidget`. A `vegawidget` is
      built using a `vegaspec`. A helper function is provided for
      [vega-embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) options. These options
      can be specified as an argument to the `vegawidget` function,
      or as an R option, `vega.embed`, which would picked up by the
      `knit_print` method.
      If the [**webshot**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=webshot)
      package and PhantomJS are installed, knitting to a non-html format should
      "just work".

      If you have the
      [**webdriver**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=webdriver) package
      and PhantomJS installed, you can convert and write a `vegaspec` or a
      `vegawidget` to PNG or SVG format.

  - title: Debugging and sharing
    desc: >
      These are functions to help you understand a `vegaspec` and to help
      you share your work with others. The `examine` function requires that
      you have the
      [**listviewer**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=listviewer) package
      installed. The functions to create and retrieve
      [blocks](https://bl.ocks.org)
      use the [**gistr**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gistr) and
      [**fs**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fs) packages, also the
      [**webdriver**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=webdriver) package
      and PhantomJS if you want upload images to your block.

  - title: Utilities and internal functions
    desc: >
      These functions help you determine the version of your `vegaspec`, the
      versions of the JavaScript libraries used to render your `vegawidget`,
      and to create a block. You will likely not need to call any of the "block"
      functions directly.
