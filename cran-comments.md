New submission

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Htmlwidget (3:8)
  JSON (4:47)
  Renderer (3:19)
  
* This is a new submission
  
* I believe the first note to be normal; as for the possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  - "Htmlwidget" and "JSON" are current terms-of-art.
  - "Renderer" is unusual, but correct.
